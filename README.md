Jim's site reboot.

## Getting Started
This guide is meant for building the site on a windows machine using Ruby and Jekyll.

### Installations

#### Install Ruby via RubyInstaller
* Download the latest x64 version of Ruby from <https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/>
 * At the time of this writing, that's `2.3.3 (x64)`
* Run the download
* Accept the license
* Allow the install to go to `C:\tools\ruby23` (trust me, it's easier later)
* Check the box to `Add Ruby Executables to your PATH`
* Complete the installation.

#### Install Ruby DevKit 2

### Environment Setup

#### Link DevKit to Your Ruby Environment

#### Install Bundler
